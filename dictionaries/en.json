        "description1": "Every year, thousands of apprenticeships remain unfilled in Germany, while elsewhere there are high unemployment rates and young people have no clear career prospects. This is one of the biggest challenges for our economy. Our mission is to create a platform that brings both sides together. In cooperation with German language schools in India, we not only not only teach students the German language, but also prepare them specifically for life and work in Germany.",
        "description2": "We introduce the students to the various training occupations and help them choose their future career path. As soon as the decision is made, we support the students through the entire recruitment process right through to their first day of work in Germany. On to our services, German companies can fill their apprenticeship vacancies and build a long-term personnel strategy."
